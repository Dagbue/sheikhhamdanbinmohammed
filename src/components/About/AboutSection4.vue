      <p class="text-3">
        Melania Trump is married to the 45th President, Donald J. Trump and the mother to their son, Barron Trump.  She is the second First Lady born outside of the United States and the only First Lady to become a naturalized United States citizen.
      </p>

      <p class="text-3">
        Melania Trump was born on April 26, 1970, in Slovenia.  At age 16, she began what would soon become a highly successful modeling career, appearing in many high profile ad campaigns and working with some of the best photographers in the fashion industry.

      <p class="text-3">
        In 1996, Mrs. Trump moved to New York and 10 years later, she proudly became a United States Citizen.  She has always been an active member of her community. In 2005, she was Honorary Chairwoman for the Martha Graham Dance Company.  That same year, she was awarded Goodwill Ambassador by the American Red Cross—a role she served in for 4 years.  Mrs. Trump served 5 years as Honorary Chairwoman for the Boys’ Club of New York and was named Woman of the Year in 2006 by the Police Athletic League.

      <p class="text-3">
        Upon assuming the role of First Lady, Mrs. Trump focused her time on the many issues affecting children across the Nation.  An unwavering characteristic of the First Lady is her aptitude for showing love and compassion in all that she does.  Mrs. Trump spent much of her time meeting with children all over the world—in classrooms, hospitals, care facilities, at home in the White House, and in communities worldwide.
      </p>
      <p class="text-3">
        BE BEST, Mrs. Trump’s awareness campaign, focused around the well-being of children and highlighting the people and programs dedicated to ensuring a better future for our next generation.  The campaign has three pillars: well-being, which includes the social and emotional health of children; online safety, which focuses on educating families on how to protect children online and promote healthy online habits; and opioid abuse, focused on protecting our most vulnerable from the effects of drug abuse while promoting resources and programs for all who struggle with addiction.
      </p>

      <p class="text-3">
        BE BEST also held a role on the international stage.  In October of 2018, First Lady Melania Trump embarked on a solo international trip to Africa; visiting Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, and Egypt, highlighting impactful hospitals, schools, and the United States Agency for International Development programs benefiting children.
      </p>
      <p class="text-3">
        In addition to BE BEST, Mrs. Trump has a deep appreciation for military and their families.  She traveled to military bases domestically and overseas, including Iraq in 2018.
      </p>
      <p class="text-3">
        The First Lady joined the President on countless international visits and met with more than 30 foreign diplomats, heads of state, and their spouses to share solutions to the issues affecting children globally.  During her time at the White House, she became an ambassador for kindness and an advocate for children.
      </p>
      <p class="text-3">
        Mrs. Trump looks forward to continuing her work on behalf of children and the issues she is passionate about.
